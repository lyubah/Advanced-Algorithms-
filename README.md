# Advanced Algorithms - Applied Projects and Techniques

This repository showcases my work from **Cpt S 515: Advanced Algorithms**, where I applied advanced algorithmic techniques to solve real-world problems. By leveraging skills in **graph algorithms**, **network flow optimization**, **mutual information analysis**, and **finite automata modeling**, I developed solutions for domains such as **data security**, **spintronics**, and **financial forecasting**. My work includes projects that utilize **Fourier analysis**, **Markov chains**, and **context-tree modeling** to address challenges in **complexity theory**, **system verification**, and **data-driven prediction models**. This repository highlights my ability to bridge theoretical foundations and practical applications.

This has been my favorite class ever! It allowed me to draw inspiration from mathematics and statistics across various fields and apply them to solve real-world industry problems, such as optimizing network flows in constrained systems, analyzing nondeterministic behaviors in spintronic devices, and developing predictive algorithms for financial data modeling.
